Golang API to MySQL To Postman Project

This is a Golang learning project. Took https://api.aladhan.com/v1/timingsByCity?city=Dhaka&country=Bangladesh (which shows prayer times and many many other info of my country Bangladesh). Only took the prayer time in a struct and then print the output in json format in IDE's output and also inserted the json values into mysql table.

Then created a http server and then converted the mysql table to json again and tested the json value in postman using GET method.
